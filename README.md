## Task 02: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Dataset
Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)

### Objective
To perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to identify
patterns and relationships between variables affecting passenger survival.

### Steps Performed
- Handled missing values (Age, Embarked)
- Removed irrelevant column (Cabin)
- Performed EDA using visualizations
- Analyzed relationships between survival, gender, age, and passenger class

### Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Key Insights
- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males
- First-class passengers had better survival chances
- Age influenced survival, with children surviving more
- Gender and passenger class were strong predictors of survival
